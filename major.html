  <h1>My Major</h1>
  <p>As stated earlier, I am a Commercial Aviation major here at UND. My ultimate career goal is to work as a demonstration pilot for an aircraft sales firm, but before that, I plan to be a Certified Flight Instructor (CFI) and Regional Airline Pilot. Currently, I am working on my CFI certificate, and I am about two weeks away from taking the test to recieve that certificate. It has been a tough flight course, but I have learned about some pretty important things. I've learned effective communication techniques, teaching methods, as well as fine tuned my flying skills as a commercial pilot. I took my commercial checkride this summer and it was an exciting experience.</p>

  <p>In addition to flying within the College of Aerospace, I also work for the College of Aerospace. I am a Student Ambassador and Tour Guide. As a Student Ambassador, I run the UND Aerospace social media, write for their alumni magazine as a student contributer, and lead current and prospective student informative panels. I answer the phones and student emails in the UND Aerospace information call center as well. As a student Tour Guide, I give tours to current and prospective students, as well as train other tour guides. </p>
    <p style=font-size:14pt;color:lightpink>The job is rewarding and fun, and has provided me with some great experiences and connections. Here I am at work.</p>
