  <h1>My Class - AVIT 415</h1>
  <p>This semester, I am taking multiple classes. The one that stands out most to me is AVIT 415. The official course title is Certified Flight Instructor - Instrument. In this course, I am learning about how to teach an aviation student how to fly in the clouds with zero visual reference to the ground! This course is a challenge, but so far it has been lots of fun. My favorite part about being a student in Aviation is getting to learn new, advanced concepts. In this course, I learn the mechanics of flight instruments, different instument flight instruction techniques, and common student frustrations in learning skills like this. </p>

  <p>AVIT 415 is a 400 level course, meaning there are lots of prerequisites needed before I am elligible to take this course. For instance, I first have to be complete with AVIT 414, which is the initial Certified Flight Instructor course. This is the logical sequence in terms of learning to teach others to fly. Before I can learn to teach the more advanced concepts, I must learn to teach the basics. AVIT 414 taught me those basics. I also need to have an Instrument rating, or a designation by the Federal Aviation Administration that states I am competent to fly in the clouds, without any visual reference to the ground! This is a very important skill when looking at the practicalities of flying. Especially when operating in somewhere like in North Dakota, the weather is not always clear blue skies! That's why knowing how to fly in the clouds is extremely important.</p>
