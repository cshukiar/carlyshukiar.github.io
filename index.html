    <h2>Carly Shukiar</h2>
  <p>Hello! My name is Carly Shukiar, and I'm excited to be a student in this CSCI 110 class. Here is a little bit of information about me.
  <ol style=color:lightpink>
    <li>Originally, I'm from Thousand Oaks, California.</li>
    <li>My major is Commercial Aviation.</li>
    <li>My minor is Psychology.</li>
    <li>I am a senior.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>I am currently a commercial pilot, but aside from flying, I love to dance, make crafts, and spend time with my friends and family. I also love to challenge myself and learn new skills, which is why I am taking this course.</p>
  <p>For more information on who I am, please see the links below. Also, here's a photo of me! Looking forward to this course and all it has to offer.
